**This repository has moved! Please see the new codebase at https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-android**

This repository contains the machine learning models and payment card utilities needed to quickly and accurately scan payment cards. [CardScan](https://cardscan.io/) is a relatively small library (1.9 MB) that provides fast and accurate payment card scanning.

Note this library does not contain any user interfaces. Another library, [cardscan-ui](https://github.com/getbouncer/cardscan-ui-android) builds upon this one any adds simple user interfaces. 

scan-payment serves as the foundation for CardScan and CardVerify enterprise libraries, which validate the authenticity of payment cards as they are scanned.
